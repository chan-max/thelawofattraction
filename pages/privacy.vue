        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Like most website operators, ShadowForge collects non-personally-identifying
          information that web browsers and servers typically make available. This
          includes information such as browser type, language preference, referring site,
          and the date and time of each visitor request. From time to time, we may release
          this information in aggregate, such as publishing reports on usage trends.

          Personally-Identifying Information
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Certain visitors to ShadowForge choose to interact with the website in ways that
          require us to collect personally-identifying information. The type and amount of
          information collected depend on the nature of the interaction. For example, we
          may ask users leaving comments or signing up for accounts to provide a username
          and email address.

        <p class="text-gray-700">
          The security of your personal information is important to us. However, no method
          of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is completely
          secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your
          personal information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
